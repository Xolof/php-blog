Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling, and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nTypically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water throughout their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon. Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory.","id":0},{"metadata":{"author":"admin","created":"2022-08-27 09:01","tags":"trout fish","updated":"2022-08-30 20:27"},"title":"Trout","slug":"trout","content":"![hero.webp](\/img\/gallery\/hero.webp)\r\n\r\nTrout are species of freshwater fish belonging to the genera Oncorhynchus, Salmo and Salvelinus, all of the subfamily Salmoninae of the family Salmonidae. The word trout is also used as part of the name of some non-salmonid fish such as Cynoscion nebulosus, the spotted seatrout or speckled trout.\r\n\r\nTrout are closely related to salmon and char (or charr): species termed salmon and char occur in the same genera as do fish called trout (Oncorhynchus \u2013 Pacific salmon and trout, Salmo \u2013 Atlantic salmon and various trout, Salvelinus \u2013 char and trout).\r\n\r\nLake trout and most other trout live in freshwater lakes and rivers exclusively, while there are others, such as the steelhead, a form of the coastal rainbow trout, that can spend two or three years at sea before returning to fresh water to spawn (a habit more typical of salmon). Arctic char and brook trout are part of the char genus. Trout are an important food source for humans and wildlife, including brown bears, birds of prey such as eagles, and other animals. They are classified as oily fish.[1]","id":1},{"metadata":{"author":"admin","created":"2022-08-27 11:00","tags":"perch fish aborre","updated":"2022-09-03 19:46"},"title":"Perch","slug":"perch","content":"![aborre.jpeg](\/img\/gallery\/aborre.jpeg)\r\n\r\nPerch is a common name for fish of the genus Perca, freshwater gamefish belonging to the family Percidae. The perch, of which three species occur in different geographical areas, lend their name to a large order of vertebrates: the Perciformes, from the Greek: \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7 (perke), simply meaning perch, and the Latin forma meaning shape. Many species of freshwater gamefish more or less resemble perch, but belong to different genera. In fact, the exclusively saltwater-dwelling red drum is often referred to as a red perch, though by definition perch are freshwater fish. Though many fish are referred to as perch as a common name, to be considered a true perch, the fish must be of the family Percidae.\r\n\r\nThe type species for this genus is the European perch, P. fluviatilis.","id":2,"comments":[{"date":"2022-08-30 16:41","comment":"test","name":"testsson"},{"date":"2022-08-31 15:15","comment":"testar","name":"test"},{"date":"2022-09-03 20:30","comment":"testar igen","name":"testsson"}]},{"metadata":{"author":"admin","created":"2022-08-31 09:23","tags":"Lakes Freshwater Germany Documentary fish","updated":"2022-09-03 19:46"},"title":"The Fascinating Wildlife in Deep Mountain Lakes","slug":"the-fascinating-wildlife-in-deep-mountain-lakes","content":"Here's a very nice video about the underwater life of deep lakes in Germany.\r\n\r\n<a  class=\"videoLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aInkqzdmmf0\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"videoLinkDiv\"><img src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/aInkqzdmmf0\/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"The Fascinating Wildlife in Deep Mountain Lakes\"><span class=\"playIcon\"><span class=\"arrow\"><\/span><\/span><\/div><\/a>","id":3,"comments":[{"date":"2022-08-31 13:52","comment":"hej","name":"testsson"}]}]
